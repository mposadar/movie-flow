# movie-flow
Demonstration project showcasing Kotlin's Flow APIs


Note:
1. this is a quick demonstration project, as such it does not have dependency injection and other production-ready setup, tests, etc.
2. some alpha and non-production-ready dependencies are used (such as AndroidX DataStore, KotlinX)
3. the app is missing some UI edge-cases such as restoring state of input and the toggle
